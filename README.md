# gwas-fix-existing-obsolete-traits
This app is supposed to fix the scenario where obsolete traits have their replacement already in the database (both present at the same time and may have linked studies/associations).

The app will replace any reference to the obsolete (linked studies/associations) trait with the replacement trait.
